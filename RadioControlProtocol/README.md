# RadioControl-Protocol
Fast and extensible communication over various serial-interfaces. Primarily designed for radio-controlled models, mesh capable.

# Example Application
Using the mesh capabilities of the protocol multiple remotes can be used by connecting them, for example via TCP. This enables us to reach a nearly unlimited range as long we have a base station. To guarantee a line-of-sight connection a drone could be used as a relay station.

# Protocol
All documentation can be found in the [protocol.pdf](https://github.com/aul12/RcViech/blob/master/protocol.pdf) file.
